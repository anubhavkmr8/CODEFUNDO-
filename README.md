REPO ON DISASTER PREDICTION AND MANAGEMENT

Prediction
Firstly,data will be collected from external sources about previous predictions and the factors which were taken into account for that specific prediction.
PREDICTION OF WEATHER-Predicting of Weather can be done by using the techniques like Regression & Functional Regression, It is the process                       of predicting continuous values and perform set of calculations and analyse data.
                      Collected datasets can be used to check the working of algorithm.It includes models such as Neural Networks,                               Probabilistic model Bayesian Network & Vector Machines..etc.
THUS,predicting wheather we can predict various natural disaster hurricanes,flood,drought.

PREDICTION OF EARTHQUAKE-We can use deep learning to to identify a static-stress-based criterion that forecasts aftershock locations                                without prior assumptions about fault orientation and from the learned aftershock pattern the maximum change in                            shear stress and the sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change
                         tensor each explain more than 98 per cent of the variance in the neural-network prediction. 
 This machine-learning based technique provides improved forecasts of aftershock locations and identifies physical quantities that may control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle
 

Prevention
AI techniques (such as image processing/recognition and classification) can be used to determine the most affected part based on real time satellite images.
Moreover,before and after disaster images can be used to determine the density of population residing in highly affected areas.

AI powered chatbots and voice assistant can be used to interact with the victims that can respond to more no.of peoples at the same time(irrespective of the victims language).
Based on their locations,AI and predictive analytics software will determine which person is in most affected area and will inform the rescue team accordingly.

Real-time images and comments from social media can be analysed and validated by AI to filter real news.In addition, AI and predictive analytics software can analyze digital content  and send messages through its linked directories or through the digital medium to the people staying close to the disaster prone areas well in advance so as to help them evacuate the area and move to a safer zone.
